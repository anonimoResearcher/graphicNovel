    <h1>FLIGHT</h1>
    <h2>by Doris Lessing</h2>
    <article class="comic">
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">Above the old man's head was the dovecote, a tall wire-netted shelf on stilts, full of strutting, preening birds. The sunlight broke on their grey breasts into small rainbows.
        </p>
          <p class="text bottom-right">  His ears were lulled by their crooning, his hands stretched up towards the favourite, a homing pigeon, a young plump bodied bird which stood still when it saw him and cocked a shrewd bright eye. 'Pretty, pretty, pretty,' he said, as he grasped the bird and drew it down, feeling the cold coral claws tighten around his finger.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left"> Content, he rested the bird lightly on his chest, and leaned against a tree, gazing out beyond the dovecote into the landscape of a late afternoon.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">In folds and hollows of sunlight and shade, the dark red soil, which was broken into great dusty clods, stretched wide to a tall horizon. Trees marked the course of the valley; a stream of rich green grass the road.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p class="text top-left">His eyes travelled homewards along this road until he saw his granddaughter swinging on the gate underneath a frangipani tree.</p>
            <p class="text bottom-right">Her hair fell down her back in a wave of sunlight, and her long bare legs repeated the angles of the frangipani stems, bare, shining-brown stems among patterns of pale blossoms.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left"> She was gazing past the pink flowers, past the railway cottage where they lived, along the road to the village.
          </p>
      </div>

        <div class="panel">
            <p class="text top-left">His mood shifted. He deliberately held out his wrist for the bird to take flight, and caught it again at the moment it spread its wings. He felt the plump shape strive and strain under his fingers and...
            </p>
            <p class = "text bottom-right">...in a sudden access of troubled spite, shut the bird into a small box and fastened the bolt. He muttered and turned his back on the shelf of birds. </p>
            <p class="speech1">Now you stay there </p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p class="text top-left">He moved warily along the hedge, stalking his granddaughter, who was now looped over the gate, her head loose on her arms, singing. </p>
            <p class = "text bottom-right"> The light happy sound mingled with the crooning of the birds, and his anger mounted.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p class="text bottom-right">He shouted; saw her jump, look back, and abandon the gate. Her eyes veiled themselves, and she spoke in a pert neutral voice. Politely she moved towards him, after a lingering backward glance at the road.</p>
            <p class="speech">Hey!</p>
            <p class="speech1">Hullo, Grandad.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p class = "text top-left"> His fingers were curling like claws into his palm.
            </p>
            <p class = "text bottom-right">She replied lightly, refusing to look at him. </p>
              <p class="speech">Waiting for Steven, hey? </p>
              <p class="speech1"> Any objection? </p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class = "text top-left">He confronted her, his eyes narrowed, shoulders hunched, tight in a hard knot of pain which included the preening birds, the sunlight, the flowers. </p>
            <p class="speech1"> Think you're old enough to go courting, hey? </p>
      </div>

        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">The girl tossed her head at the old-fashioned phrase and sulked.  
          </p>
            <p class="speech1">Oh, Grandad!</p>
            <p class="speech">Think you want to leave home, hey? Think you can go running around the fields at night?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">Her smile made him see her, as he had every evening of this warm end-of-summer month...</p>
          <p class="text bottom-right">...swinging 
            hand in hand along the road to the village with that red-handed, red throated, violent-bodied youth, 
            the son of the postmaster.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">Misery went to his head and he shouted angrily. </p>
            <p class="text bottom-right">She answered laughing, and went back to the gate. He heard her singing, for him to hear.</p>
            <p class="speech1">I'll tell your mother! </p>
            <p class="speech">Tell away! <i class="fa-solid fa-music"></i> I've 
              got you under my skin, I've got you deep in the heart of ... <i class="fa-solid fa-music"></i> </p>

        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text bottom-right">Growling under his breath he turned towards the dovecote, which was his refuge from the house he shared with his daughter and her husband and their children. </p>
            <p class="speech1">Rubbish, rubbish. Impudent little bit of rubbish!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">But now the house would be empty. Gone all the young girls with 
            their laughter and their squabbling and their teasing. </p>
          <p class="text bottom-right"> He would be left, uncherished and alone, with 
            that square-fronted, calm-eyed woman, his daughter.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text bottom-right">He stopped, muttering, before the dovecote, resenting the absorbed cooing birds. From the gate 
            the girl shouted. </p>
            <p class="speech">Go and tell! Go on, what are you waiting for?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">Obstinately he made his way to the house, with quick, pathetic persistent glances of appeal back at 
            her. </p>
        <p class= "text bottom-right">But she never looked around. Her defiant but anxious young body stung him into love and 
            repentance.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text bottom-right">He stopped, muttering, waiting for her to turn and run to him. She did not turn. She had forgotten him.</p>
            <p class="speech1">But I never meant...I didn't mean...</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">Along the road came the young man Steven, with 
            something in his hand. </p>
            <p class="text bottom-right">A present for her?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">The old man stiffened as he watched the gate swing back, 
            and the couple embrace. In the brittle shadows of the frangipani tree his granddaughter, his darling, 
            lay in the arms of the postmaster's son, and her hair flowed back over his shoulder. 
        </p>
            <p class="text bottom-right">He shouted spitefully. They did not move.</p>
            <p class="speech"> I see you!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">He stumped into the little 
            whitewashed house, hearing the wooden veranda creak angrily under his feet.</p>
            <p class="text bottom-right"> His daughter was 
              sewing in the front room, threading a needle held to the light.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">He stopped again, looking back into the garden. The couple were now sauntering among the 
            bushes, laughing. </p>
            <p class="text bottom-right">As he watched he saw the girl escape from the youth with a sudden mischievous 
              movement, and run off through the flowers with him in pursuit. He heard shouts, laughter, a 
              scream, silence.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text bottom-right"> He muttered miserably.</p>
            <p class="speech1">But it's not like that at all. It's not like that. Why can't you see? Running 
              and giggling, and kissing and kissing. You'll come to something quite different. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">He looked at his daughter with sardonic hatred, hating himself. They were caught and finished, 
            both of them, but the girl was still running free.  </p>
            <p class="text bottom-right"> 'Can't you see?' he demanded of his invisible granddaughter, who was at that moment lying in the 
              thick green grass with the postmaster's son.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">His daughter looked at him and her eyebrows went up in tired forbearance.</p>
            <p class="text bottom-right"> She was humouring him.</p>
            <p class="speech1"> Put your birds to bed? </p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
            <p class="text top-left">He spoke urgently.</p>
            <p class="speech1" id="speech1">Lucy,Lucy... </p> 
            <p class="speech" id="speech2">Well, what is it now?</p>
            <p class="speech1" id="speech3">She's in the garden with Steven</p>
            <p class="speech" id="speech4">Now you just sit down and have your tea</p>

        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text bottom-right">He stumped his feet alternately, thump, thump, on the hollow wooden floor and shouted.</p>
            <p class="speech1">She'll 
              marry him. I'm telling you, she'll be marrying him next!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">His daughter rose swiftly, brought him a cup, set him a plate. </p>
            <p class="text bottom-right">
              <p class="speech" id="first">I don't want any tea. I don't want it, I 
            tell you.</p>
            <p class="speech1" id="second">Now, now, what's wrong with it? Why not? 
            </p>
        <p class="speech" id="third">She's eighteen. Eighteen!</p>
        <p class="speech4" id="fourth">I was married at seventeen and I never regretted it.</p>
            </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="speech1">Liar, liar. Then you should regret it. Why do you make your girls marry? It's you who do 
            it. What do you do it for? Why? 
          <p class="speech"> The other three have done fine. They've three fine husbands. Why not Alice? </p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left"> He mourned...
            <p class="speech1">She's the last, can't we keep her a bit longer?</p>
            <p class="speech">Come, now, Dad. She'll be down the road, that's all. She'll be here every day to see you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left"> He thought of the other three girls, transformed inside a few months from 
            charming petulant spoiled children into serious young matrons. </p>
            <p class="speech1">But it's not the same.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left"> She sighed, letting her 
            eyes linger on the sunlit garden.</p>
            <p class="speech3">You never did like it when we married. Why not? Every time, it's the same. When I got 
              married you made me feel like it was something wrong. And my girls the same. You get them all 
              crying and miserable the way you go on. Leave Alice alone. She's happy. She'll marry next month. There's no reason to wait.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left"> He was incredulous. </p>
            <p class="text bottom-right"> She replied coldly, and took up her sewing.
            <p class="speech1">You've said they can marry?</p>
            <p class="speech">Yes, Dad, why not?</p> 
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">His eyes stung, and he went out on to the veranda. Wet spread down over his chin and he took out 
            a handkerchief and mopped his whole face. </p>
            <p class="text bottom-right"> The garden was empty.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">From around the corner came the young couple; but their faces were no longer set against him. </p>
          <p class="text bottom-right">On the wrist of the postmaster's son balanced a young pigeon, the light gleaming on its breast.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left"> The old man let the drops shake off his chin. </p>
            <p class="text bottom-right"> The girl grabbed his hand and swung on it.</p>
            <p class="speech1">For me? For me?</p>
            <p class="speech"> Do you like it? It's for you, Grandad. Steven brought it 
              for you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left"> They hung about him, affectionate, concerned, trying to charm away his wet eyes and his 
            misery. They took his arms and directed him to the shelf of birds, one on each side, enclosing him, 
            petting him, saying wordlessly that nothing would be changed, nothing could change, and that they 
            would be with him always. </p>
            <p class="text bottom-right">The bird was proof of it, they said, from their lying happy eyes, as they 
              thrust it on him.</p>
            <p class="speech">There, Grandad, it's yours. It's for you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">They watched him as he held it on his wrist, stroking its soft, sun-warmed back, watching the wings 
            lift and balance. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">The girl spoke intimately, and the old man growled back at her. </p>
          <p class="text bottom-right">
            Released by his half-deliberate anger, they fell back, laughing at him.</p>
            <p class="speech1" id="alice1">You must shut it up for a bit. Until it knows this is its home.</p>
            <p class="speech4" id="oldman">Teach your 
              grandmother to suck eggs.</p>
            <p class="speech4" id="alice2"> We're glad you like it.</p>
          </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">They moved off, now serious and full of purpose, to the gate, where they hung, backs to him, talking 
            quietly. More than anything could, their grown-up seriousness shut him out, making him alone.</p>
            <p class="text bottom-right">Also, it quietened him, took the sting out of their tumbling like puppies on the grass. They had forgotten 
              him again.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">The old man reassured himself, feeling his throat clotted with tears, 
              his lips trembling.</p>
          <p class="speech1">Well, so they should.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">He held the new bird to his face, for the caress of its silken feathers. </p>
            <p class="text bottom-right">Then he 
              shut it in a box and took out his favourite.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">He held it poised, ready for flight, while he looked down the 
            garden towards the boy and the girl. </p>
            <p class="text bottom-right">Then, clenched in the pain of loss, he lifted the bird on his 
              wrist, and watched it soar.</p>
            <p class="speech1">Now you can go.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left"> A whirr and a spatter of wings, and a cloud of birds rose into the evening 
            from the dovecote.</p>
            <p class="text bottom-right">At the gate Alice and Steven forgot their talk and watched the birds.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">On the veranda, that woman, his daughter, stood gazing, her eyes shaded with a hand that still held 
            her sewing. </p>
            <p class="text bottom-right"> It seemed to the old man that the whole afternoon had stilled to watch his gesture of self-command, 
              that even the leaves of the trees had stopped shaking. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">Dry-eyed and calm, he let his hands fall to his sides and stood erect, staring up into the sky. </p>
            <p class="text bottom-right">The cloud of shining silver birds flew up and up, with a shrill cleaving of wings, over the dark 
              ploughed land and the darker belts of trees and the bright folds of grass, until they floated high in 
              the sunlight, like a cloud of motes of dust.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">They wheeled in a wide circle, tilting their wings so there was flash after flash of light, and one after 
            another they dropped from the sunshine of the upper sky to shadow, one after another... </p>
          <p class="text bottom-right">...returning 
            to the shadowed earth over trees and grass and field, returning to the valley and the shelter of night. The garden was all a fluster and a flurry of returning birds.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">Then silence, and the sky was empty. </p>
          <p class="text bottom-right">The old man turned, slowly, taking his time; he lifted his eyes to smile proudly down the garden at 
            his granddaughter.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <p class="text top-left">She was staring at him. She did not smile. She was wide-eyed, and pale in the 
            cold shadow, and he saw the tears run shivering off her face.</p>
          <p class="text bottom-right">THE END.</p>
